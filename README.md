# Text-Message-Alert

This my project from the CUNY Hackathon 2019, the projects theme is the environment.
The project is based on the premise that people will tweet about an event as they are happening, so we wanted to use that live data to give people a heads up about a potential danger.
This project will send users a text message about an ongoing wildfire.
Using the Twitter API and IBM Watson this program is able to determine the relevancy of a tweet using Natural Language Processing.
If the threshold is met the program will send a text message to the user about a wildfire.

This program was written with the intent to give users a live update about wildfires occuring at the moment, but it can easily be changed to alert users of other events such as earthquakes, tornados, or even the lastet trending topic.
